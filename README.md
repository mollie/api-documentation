We take pull requests on our documentation as well, if you think that something can be improved please open a PR.

The documentation is formatted using [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/rest.html). All
documentation should be written in US English.

Note that PhpStorm comes with a reStructuredText plugin. You can enable it from the Plugins preferences pane. It enables
some syntax highlighting.
