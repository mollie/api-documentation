Recurring payments
==================
Recurring payments can be used to charge customers on a regular basis or to offer automatic top-ups with credits-based
services. Since the amount for a recurring payment is variable, other innovative use-cases are possible as well. Like
doing a partial prepayment and later a final recurring payment, for more expensive products. Or charging a customer in
your Dashboard manually, for orders by phone.

Recurring payments happen in the background. The customer goes through the payment steps only once, for the **first**
payment.

Reducing the risk of chargebacks
--------------------------------
To reduce the risk of chargebacks, it's recommended to communicate how often and how much the customer will be charged
as clearly as possible. We suggest notifying the customer a couple of days in advance of the next payment, for example
by sending them an email.

How to get started
------------------
In the following sections we explain the following topics.

* :ref:`Setting up the first payment <payments/recurring/first-payment>`
* :ref:`Charging immediately on-demand <payments/recurring/charging-on-demand>`
* :ref:`Charging periodically with subscriptions <payments/recurring/charging-periodically>`
* :ref:`How do webhooks for subscriptions work? <payments/recurring/subscription-webhooks>`

For more information on how to test recurring payments, refer to our :doc:`guide </overview/testing>` for testing the
Mollie API.

.. _payments/recurring/first-payment:

Setting up the first payment
----------------------------
In order to get started with recurring payments you need to require the customer's consent through a first payment. It's
similar to a regular payment, but the customer is shown information about your organization, and the customer needs to
complete the payment with the account or card that will be used for recurring charges in the future. After the first
payment is completed successfully, the customer's account or card will immediately be chargeable *on-demand*, or
periodically through *subscriptions*.

#. Create a unique customer using the :doc:`Customers API </reference/v2/customers-api/overview>`. If you are using
   Mollie Connect, make sure you have the permission `customers.write` in order to create a customer.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :linenos:

      curl -X POST https://api.mollie.com/v2/customers \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d "{\"name\":\"Customer A\",\"email\":\"customer@example.org\"}"

#. Save the customer's ``id`` in your database. You need it for the next step.

#. Create a payment (or order) for the customer by specifying the ``customerId`` and setting the ``sequenceType``
   parameter to ``first``.

   .. note:: For credit card and PayPal payments, you can create a payment with a zero amount. No money will then be
             debited from the card or account when doing the first payment.
             If you intend to start a subscription, you can use this payment as the first instalment, e.g. by charging
             the amount you will periodically charge. Next, you can set up a subscription which starts after the first
             period. See also the `startDate` field in the
             :doc:`Subscriptions API </reference/v2/subscriptions-api/overview>`.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :linenos:

      curl -X POST https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d \
          "{
              \"amount\": {\"currency\":\"EUR\", \"value\":\"0.01\"},
              \"customerId\": \"cst_Ok2DlrJe5\",
              \"sequenceType\": \"first\",
              \"description\": \"First payment\",
              \"redirectUrl\": \"https://webshop.example.org/order/12345/\",
              \"webhookUrl\": \"https://webshop.example.org/payments/webhook/\"
          }"

#. Redirect the customer to the ``_links.checkout.href`` to complete the first payment. Make sure to use an HTTP ``GET``
   redirect. You can find an example of the hosted checkout in `our demo environment <https://demo.mollie.com>`_.

#. Once completed there will be a customer mandate that you can access via the
   :doc:`Mandates API </reference/v2/mandates-api/overview>`. If the first payment was paid using a ``creditcard``, the
   resulting mandate method will be ``creditcard`` as well. ``paypal`` will result in a ``paypal`` mandate. Virtually
   all other first payment methods will be a ``directdebit`` mandate.

.. note:: Not all payment methods support a first payment. When the ``method`` parameter is not provided in the API, we
          take care of this automatically in our :doc:`Checkout </payments/hosted-checkout>`. The following payment
          methods support a first payment and are thus allowed as a value for the ``method`` parameter of a first
          payment:
          ``applepay`` ``bancontact`` ``belfius`` ``creditcard`` ``eps`` ``giropay`` ``ideal`` ``kbc`` ``mybank``
          ``paypal`` ``sofort``

.. note:: Created mandates are unique to your account and can not be transferred to other accounts.

.. warning:: Using recurring payments with PayPal is only possible if PayPal has activated Reference Transactions on
             your merchant account. Check if your account is eligible via our
             :doc:`Methods API </reference/v2/methods-api/overview>`. Make sure to set the ``sequenceType`` parameter to
             ``first``. Your account is eligible if you get PayPal as method returned.

.. _payments/recurring/charging-on-demand:

Charging immediately on-demand
------------------------------
Now that the customer has given their consent, it's possible to perform a recurring payment on-demand. Instead of the
regular payment with a ``redirectUrl``, a recurring payment happens in the background without a browser session, i.e.
without the customer going through payments steps. You can create a recurring payment with the ``sequenceType`` set to
``recurring`` when creating a payment with the :doc:`Payments API </reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment>`.

In order to do recurring payments, SEPA Direct Debit, PayPal or credit card has to be activated on your profile.

#. Make sure the customer has valid mandates. Find out using the
   :doc:`Mandates API </reference/v2/mandates-api/overview>`.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :linenos:

      curl -X GET https://api.mollie.com/v2/customers/cst_4qqhO89gsT/mandates \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM"

#. If there's at least one mandate with a ``status`` set to ``valid`` then continue.

#. Set the ``sequenceType`` parameter to ``recurring`` to charge the customer on-demand.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :linenos:

      curl -X POST https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d \
          "{
              \"amount\": {\"currency\": \"EUR\", \"value\": \"10.00\"},
              \"customerId\": \"cst_Ok2DlrJe5\",
              \"sequenceType\": \"recurring\",
              \"description\": \"Background payment\",
              \"webhookUrl\": \"https://webshop.example.org/payments/webhook/\"
          }"

#. Like regular payments your :doc:`webhook </overview/webhooks>` is called for retrieving status updates.

.. note:: You should include the PayPal fraud library when you use PayPal for on-demand payments.

.. _payments/recurring/charging-periodically:

Charging periodically with subscriptions
----------------------------------------
For simple regular recurring payments with constant amounts, you can create *subscriptions* with the
:doc:`Subscriptions API </reference/v2/subscriptions-api/overview>`. Subscription payments will be spawned automatically
at the specified frequency, and will show up in your Dashboard.

#. Make sure the customer has a pending or valid mandate using the
   :doc:`Mandates API </reference/v2/mandates-api/overview>`.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :linenos:

      curl -X GET https://api.mollie.com/v2/customers/cst_4qqhO89gsT/mandates \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM"

#. Continue if there's a mandate with its ``status`` being either ``pending`` or ``valid``, otherwise set up a *first*
   payment for the customer first.

#. Create the subscription using the
   :doc:`Create subscription endpoint </reference/v2/subscriptions-api/create-subscription>`.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :linenos:

      curl -X POST https://api.mollie.com/v2/customers/cst_Ok2DlrJe5/subscriptions \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d \
          "{
              \"amount\": {\"currency\":\"EUR\", \"value\":\"25.00\"},
              \"times\": 4,
              \"interval\": \"3 months\",
              \"description\": \"Quarterly payment\",
              \"webhookUrl\": \"https://webshop.example.org/subscriptions/webhook/\"
          }"

#. In the above example the customer is charged â‚¬25.00 for 4 times every 3 months, starting today.

#. The webhook URL will be triggered for every payment to communicate any status updates.

Refer to the documentation of the API client you are using for more examples.

.. _payments/recurring/subscription-webhooks:

How do webhooks for subscriptions work?
---------------------------------------
When using our Subscriptions API to charge a customer periodically, new payments are created by Mollie every time the
customer is charged. We will call your webhook as usual for these payments. The only difference is, the payment ID will
not be known by your system yet when we call the webhook to report the payment's status.

With normal payments you know the payment ID, because you've received this when creating the payment. With
subscriptions you do not know the payment ID in advance.  You will receive a webhook call with a payment ID that you
have likely never seen before.

The payment object will, however, contain a ``subscriptionId`` field that contains the subscription ID you received when
the subscription was created. This allows you to recognize where the payment belongs to.

We do not provide webhooks specifically for status changes of a Subscription itself.

How to implement the PayPal fraud library?
------------------------------------------
.. note:: You do not have to implement the library for recurring payments.

Using PayPal for on-demand payments requires an extra set of tools. You should integrate the fraud library of PayPal by
adding the Javascript library to your checkout page with the necessary configuration included.

You need to load the library from the PayPal domain through a ``<script>``-tag. Before that, you should provide the
configuration for the library with a ``<script>``-tag of the type ``application/json``. Both tags should be placed
inside the ``<head>`` section.

In the configuration block you need to make sure that you include the ``fncls`` attribute as follows:
``fncls="fnparams-dede7cc5-15fd-4c75-a9f4-36c430ee3a99"``. The library cannot find your configuration without that
attribute.

The configuration should contain JSON with the following attributes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``s``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - Your unique PayPal Website ID. Contact your PayPal account manager to get this identifier.

   * - ``f``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - A unique session ID for the current payment. It should be different on every page load and can be 32 characters
       long. This ID should be posted to us when you create the actual payment via the ``sessionId`` parameter.

.. warning:: Make sure that your configuration block is above the library ``<script>``-tag. Otherwise it will not work.

**Example**

.. code-block:: html
      :linenos:

      <head>
        ...
        <script type="application/json" fncls="fnparams-dede7cc5-15fd-4c75-a9f4-36c430ee3a99">
            {
               "f": "Tk149lticPjL40UUj9cb", // A random session ID, max. 32 characters
               "s": "QkEhN94Ba"            // Your PayPal Website ID
            }
        </script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://c.paypal.com/da/r/fb.js"></script>
        ...
      </head>
