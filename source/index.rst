Mollie API documentation
========================
With the Mollie API you can integrate online payments by Mollie directly into your website or app.

To get started quickly, you can simply drop Mollie into your hosted webshop with one of our free integrations, or
leverage one of our existing API packages for a more advanced setup.

We have integrations available for virtually all common e-commerce software, bookkeeping platforms, and so on.
These can be found in our `integrations directory <https://www.mollie.com/integrations>`_.

For more advanced users, we have made Mollie API packages available for the most popular programming languages and
frameworks. These include `PHP <https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-php>`_,
`Ruby <https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-ruby>`_, `Node.js <https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-node>`_,
and `Python <https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-python>`_. Refer to our
`package list <https://www.mollie.com/developers/packages>`_ for more packages and plugins.

If you have any questions about integrating our API, `contact us <https://www.mollie.com/contact>`_. We are happy
to help!

API guides
----------
To get to know the Mollie API better, a good starting point is to first navigate the *Mollie API* section in the sidebar
of the current page. These guides take you through the basic flow of authentication, handling responses and errors, and
receiving webhooks.

Next, to learn more about the inner workings and features of our payment processing APIs, refer to the
:doc:`Payments guides </payments/accepting-payments>`.

Optionally, for Mollie users building platforms or products for other merchants or Mollie users, we offer Mollie
Connect. Mollie Connect is a set of APIs and tools that allows you to connect multiple Mollie accounts together, for
example to create a white-labeled experiences or to distribute funds across multiple accounts. Read more in the
:doc:`Mollie Connect guides </connect/overview>`.

Lastly, all endpoints of our APIs are also extensively documented in the
:doc:`API reference section </reference/v2/payments-api/overview>`, with property lists and code examples for each
endpoint.
