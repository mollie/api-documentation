Mollie API documentation
========================
With the Mollie API you can integrate online payments by Mollie directly into your website or app.

To get up and running quickly, we recommend starting out with one of our existing :ref:`integrations <clients>`.

For more advanced users wishing to implement our API directly, we recommend starting out with the
:ref:`Mollie API package <clients>` for your programming language of choice.

If you have any questions about integrating our API, please `contact us <https://www.mollie.com/contact>`_. We are happy
to help!
