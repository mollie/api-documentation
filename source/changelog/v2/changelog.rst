March 2020
==========

Tuesday, 24th
-------------
- Mollie is moving to a monthly invoicing system. As some settlements span multiple months, these settlements will have
  their associated costs put on multiple invoices (one for each month). To accommodate the linking of specific costs to
  the specific invoice of that month, an ``invoiceId`` field is included for each monthly period (see the
  :doc:`Get settlement endpoint </reference/v2/settlements-api/get-settlement>`).

  For such settlements that span multiple months, the top-level ``invoiceId`` field now refers only to the oldest
  invoice. This could cause your bookkeeping integration to break as the invoice referenced by this ID will no longer
  cover all costs. The new ``invoiceId`` field of each period should be used instead.

  :doc:`Create shipment endpoint </reference/v2/shipments-api/create-shipment>` optional.

- It is now possible to specify a URL with a custom URI scheme as ``redirectUrl`` parameter. Previously, only the *HTTP*
  and *HTTPS* schemes were allowed. You can for example immediately redirect the customer back to your mobile app after
  completing a payment, by setting the ``redirectUrl`` to your own App Scheme, like ``my-app://payment-return``.

Friday, 12th
------------
- Added new category codes ``5533`` ``5641`` ``5651`` ``5732`` ``5735`` ``5815`` ``5944`` ``5977`` ``7999``
  to the :doc:`Create profile </reference/v2/profiles-api/create-profile>` and
  :doc:`Update profile </reference/v2/profiles-api/update-profile>` endpoints.

Friday, 5th
------------
- We have added the ``mandateId`` field in subscriptions. This makes it possible to sure a specific mandate for a
  subscription. For details, see the :doc:`Subscriptions API </reference/v2/subscriptions-api/overview>`.

Tuesday, 2nd
------------
- We have removed the dedicated French bank account for bank transfer payments. Your customers can use our Dutch
  bank account to finish the payment.

- Added the new payment status ``authorized`` for payments that still require a capture to receive the money. Currently,
  this status is only used for payment methods `Klarna Pay now <https://www.mollie.com/en/payments/klarna-pay-now>`_,
  `Klarna Pay later <https://www.mollie.com/payments/klarna-pay-later>`_ and
  `Klarna Slice it <https://www.mollie.com/payments/klarna-slice-it>`_. Because payments with these payment methods
  can only be created with the :doc:`Orders API </reference/v2/orders-api/overview>`, there is no change required in
  existing implementations of the Payments API.

  The new status is especially useful to give a meaningful representation when listing all payments.

  :doc:`/reference/v2/chargebacks-api/get-payment-chargeback` endpoint.
