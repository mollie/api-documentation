Authorize
=========
.. api-name:: OAuth API

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://my.mollie.com/oauth2/authorize

.. note:: You should construct the Authorize URL from the endpoint above with the parameters below. Then, you should
          redirect the resource owner to the Authorize endpoint.

The Authorize endpoint is the endpoint on Mollie web site where the merchant logs in, and grants authorization to your
client application. E.g. when the merchant clicks on the :doc:`Connect with Mollie button </connect/getting-started>`,
you should redirect the merchant to the Authorize endpoint.

The resource owner can then grant the authorization to your client application for the scopes you have requested.

Mollie will then redirect the resource owner to the ``redirect_uri`` you have specified. The ``redirect_uri`` will be
appended with a ``code`` parameter, which will contain the *auth token*. You should then exchange the *auth token* for
an *access token* using the :doc:`Tokens API </reference/oauth2/tokens>`.

.. parameter:: redirect_uri
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   when registering your app.

.. parameter:: state
   :type: string
   :condition: required

   A random string generated by your app to prevent CSRF attacks.

.. parameter:: scope

.. parameter:: locale
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   Allows you to preset the language to be used in the login / sign up / authorize flow if the merchant is not known by
   Mollie. When this parameter is omitted, the browser language will be used instead. You can provide any ``xx_XX``

.. parameter:: state
   :type: string

   expected value.

.. parameter:: error
   :type: string

   If the request is canceled by the merchant, or fails for any other reason, the merchant will be redirected back with
   an ``error`` field. The field will contain a code indicating the type of error.

.. parameter:: error_description
   :type: string

   If the ``error`` field is present, this field will be present as well with an explanation of the error code.
