Get payment
===========
.. api-name:: Payments API
   :version: 1

.. warning:: The v1 API has been deprecated. The v1 API will be supported for the foreseeable future, at least until
             July 2023. However, new features will only be added to the v2 API.

             The documentation for retrieving payments in the new v2 API can be found
             :doc:`here </reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment>`. For more information on the v2 API, refer to our
             :doc:`v2 migration guide </payments/migrating-v1-to-v2>`.

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v1/payments/*id*

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :oauth: true

Retrieve a single payment object by its payment token.

.. note:: We call your webhook when the :doc:`payment status changes </payments/status-changes>`, so there's no
          need to poll this endpoint for status changes.

Parameters
----------
Replace ``id`` in the endpoint URL by the payment's ID, for example ``tr_7UhSN1zuXS``.

Mollie Connect/OAuth parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are creating an app with Mollie Connect (OAuth), the ``testmode`` parameter is available. You must pass this as a
parameter in the query string if you want to retrieve a payment that was created in test mode.

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``testmode``

       .. type:: boolean
          :required: false

     - Set this to ``true`` to get a payment made in test mode. If you omit this parameter, you can only retrieve live
       mode payments.

Includes
^^^^^^^^
This endpoint allows you to include additional information by appending the following values via the ``include``
querystring parameter.

* ``settlement`` Include the settlement this payment belongs to, when available.
* ``details.qrCode`` Include a :doc:`QR code </guides/qr-codes>` object. Only available for iDEAL, Bitcoin, Bancontact
  and bank transfer payments.
