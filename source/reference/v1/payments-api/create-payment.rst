Create payment
==============
.. api-name:: Payments API
   :version: 1

.. warning:: The v1 API has been deprecated. The v1 API will be supported for the foreseeable future, at least until
             July 2023. However, new features will only be added to the v2 API.

             The documentation for creating payments in the new v2 API can be found
             :doc:`here </reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment>`. For more information on the v2 API, refer to our
             :doc:`v2 migration guide </payments/migrating-v1-to-v2>`.

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v1/payments

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :oauth: true

Payment creation is elemental to the Mollie API: this is where most payment implementations start off. Note optional
parameters are accepted for certain payment methods.

To wrap your head around the payment process, an explanation and flow charts can be found in the
:doc:`Overview </payments/overview>`.

Parameters
----------
.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``amount``

       .. type:: decimal
          :required: true

     - The amount in EUR that you want to charge, e.g. 100.00 if you would want to charge €100.00.

   * - ``description``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - The description of the payment you're creating. This will be shown to the consumer on their card or bank
       statement when possible, and in any exports you generate.

       We recommend you use the order number so that you can always link the payment to the order. This is particularly
       useful for bookkeeping.

   * - ``redirectUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - `The URL the customer will be redirected to after the payment process. It could make sense for the
       ``redirectUrl`` to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the right page referencing
       the order when your customer returns.

   * - ``webhookUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - Set the webhook URL, where we will send payment status updates to.

       .. note:: The ``webhookUrl`` must be reachable from Mollie's point of view. If you want to use webhook during
          development on ``localhost``, you must use a tool like
          `ngrok <https://lornajane.net/posts/2015/test-incoming-webhooks-locally-with-ngrok>`_ to have the webhooks
          delivered to your local machine.

   * - ``locale``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Allows you to preset the language to be used in the hosted payment pages shown to the consumer. Setting a
       locale is highly recommended and will greatly improve your conversion rate. When this parameter is omitted, the
       browser language will be used instead if supported by the payment method. You can provide any ISO 15897 locale,
       but our hosted payment pages currently only support the following languages:

       Possible values: ``en_US`` ``nl_NL`` ``nl_BE`` ``fr_FR`` ``fr_BE`` ``de_DE`` ``de_AT`` ``de_CH`` ``es_ES``
       ``ca_ES`` ``pt_PT`` ``it_IT`` ``nb_NO`` ``sv_SE`` ``fi_FI`` ``da_DK`` ``is_IS`` ``hu_HU`` ``pl_PL`` ``lv_LV``
       ``lt_LT``

   * - ``method``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Normally, a payment method selection screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, your
       customer will skip the selection screen and will be sent directly to the chosen payment method. The parameter
       enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website, however note Mollie's country
       based conversion optimization is lost.

       Possible values: ``banktransfer`` ``belfius`` ``bitcoin`` ``creditcard`` ``directdebit`` ``eps`` ``giftcard``
       ``giropay`` ``ideal`` ``inghomepay`` ``kbc`` ``mistercash`` ``paypal`` ``paysafecard`` ``sofort``

   * - ``metadata``

       .. type:: mixed
          :required: false

     - Provide any data you like, and we will save the data alongside the payment. Whenever
       you fetch the payment with our API, we'll also include the metadata. You can use up to approximately 1kB.

   * - ``recurringType``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Enables recurring payments. If set to ``first``, a first payment for the customer is created, allowing
       the customer to agree to automatic recurring charges taking place on their account in the future. If set to
       ``recurring``, the customer's card is charged automatically.

       Possible values: ``first`` ``recurring``

   * - ``customerId``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - The ID of the :doc:`Customer </reference/v1/customers-api/get-customer>` for whom the payment is being
       created. This is used for recurring payments and :doc:`single click payments </guides/checkout>`.

   * - ``mandateId``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - When creating recurring payments, the ID of a specific :doc:`Mandate </reference/v1/mandates-api/get-mandate>`
       may be supplied to indicate which of the consumer's accounts should be credited.

Payment method specific parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you specify the ``method`` parameter, optional parameters may be available for the payment method. If no method is
specified, you can still send the optional parameters and we will apply them when the consumer selects the relevant
payment method.

   * - ``billingEmail``

       payment instructions will be sent immediately when creating the payment. If you don't specify the ``locale``

     - The date the payment should :doc:`expire </payments/status-changes>`, in ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format.

       Possible values: ``en_US`` ``nl_NL`` ``nl_BE`` ``fr_FR`` ``fr_BE`` ``de_DE`` ``de_AT`` ``de_CH`` ``es_ES``

QR codes can be generated for iDEAL, Bitcoin, Bancontact and bank transfer payments.

Refer to the :doc:`Get payment </reference/v1/payments-api/get-payment>` reference to see what the API response looks
like when the QR code is included.
