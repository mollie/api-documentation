Cancel refund
=============
.. api-name:: Refunds API
   :version: 1

.. warning:: The v1 API has been deprecated. The v1 API will be supported for the foreseeable future, at least until
             July 2023. However, new features will only be added to the v2 API.

             The documentation for canceling refunds in the new v2 API can be found
             :doc:`here </reference/v2/refunds-api/cancel-refund>`. For more information on the v2 API, refer to our
             :doc:`v2 migration guide </payments/migrating-v1-to-v2>`.

.. endpoint::
   :method: DELETE
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v1/payments/*paymentId*/refunds/*id*

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: false
   :oauth: true

For certain payment methods, like iDEAL, the underlying banking system will delay refunds until the next day. Until that
time, :doc:`refunds </payments/refunds>` may be canceled manually via the Mollie Dashboard, or programmatically by using
this endpoint.

The refund can only be canceled while the refund's ``status`` field is either ``queued`` or ``pending``. See
:doc:`/payments/refunds` for more information.

Parameters
----------
Replace ``paymentId`` in the endpoint URL by the payment's ID, and replace ``id`` by the refund's ID. For example:
``/v1/payments/tr_7UhSN1zuXS/refunds/re_4qqhO89gsT``.

Mollie Connect/OAuth parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're creating an app with :doc:`Mollie Connect/OAuth </oauth/overview>`, the ``testmode`` parameter is also
available.

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``testmode``

       .. type:: boolean
          :required: false

     - Set this to ``true`` to cancel a test mode refund.
