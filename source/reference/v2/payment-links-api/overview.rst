Payment links API
=================
With the Payment links API you can generate a payment link to share with your customer. The payment link can for example
be attached to an unpaid invoice or shared via email or chat applications.

This API is different from the :doc:`Payments API </reference/v2/payments-api/overview>`, since links generated by the
Payments API are only short-lived. The **Payments API** should therefore only be used when the customer is ready to
check out, while the **Payment links API** can be used in cases where the customer wants to pay at their own
convenience.
