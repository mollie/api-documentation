Create organization
===================
.. api-name:: Organization API
   :version: 2

.. warning::
   This API is currently in development and not available yet.

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/organization

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :oauth: false

Partners that wish to create accounts at Mollie for their customers, can do so via the **Create organization API**.

Any accounts created this way will be eligible for kickback on any processed payments and your customer can allow your
OAuth application access to his or her account at Mollie.

How does it work?
-----------------

Using the Create organization API, you can submit any information you already have on the organization. Mollie will then
provide you with a pre-filled registration form for your customer. Your customer can review and amend the information
you send, set a password and grant access to your OAuth application. At this point, Mollie will create an Organization
for the customer.

The customer will then come back to your application or service via the :doc:`OAuth authorization flow</oauth/overview>`.

Once the customer is connected, the organization will appear in the List Customers API.

Authentication
--------------

The API call to create the organization should be authenticated with a **Personal access token**. Once your customer has
created the organization and granted you access, you will receive an *auth code* which you can then exchange for an
**access token** which is valid for the app identified with the ``client_id`` parameter.

The access token will have the scopes you requested granted to it. Using this access token, you can access the new
organization with your app.

.. note::
   This API can only be used by Partners. If you want to become a partner of Mollie, please see our
   `website <https://www.mollie.com/en/partners/>`_ and join our Partner Program.
