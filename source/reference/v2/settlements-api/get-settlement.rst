Get settlement
==============
.. api-name:: Settlements API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/settlements/*id*

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: false
   :oauth: true

Successful payments are collected into *settlements*, which are then paid out according to your account's payout
schedule. By retrieving a single settlement, you can check which payments were paid out with it, when the settlement
took place, and what invoice reference was used for it.

Settlements will be transferred to your bank account with a ``reference``, for example ``1182161.1506.02``. You can use
the :doc:`List settlements </reference/v2/settlements-api/get-settlement>` endpoint to look up a settlement by
reference.

Parameters
----------
Replace ``id`` in the endpoint URL by the settlement's ID, for example ``stl_jDk30akdN``.

Response
--------
``200`` ``application/hal+json; charset=utf-8``
