       .. type:: string

     - Indicates the response contains a refund object. Will always contain ``refund`` for this endpoint.

   * - ``id``

       .. type:: string

     - The refund's unique identifier, for example ``re_4qqhO89gsT``.

   * - ``amount``

       .. type:: amount object

     - The amount refunded to your customer with this refund.

       .. list-table::
          :widths: auto

          * - ``currency``

              .. type:: string

            - An `ISO 4217 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`_ currency code. The currencies supported depend on
              the payment methods that are enabled on your account.

          * - ``value``

              .. type:: string

            - A string containing the exact amount that was refunded in the given currency.

   * - ``settlementAmount``

       .. type:: amount object|null

     -   This optional field will contain the amount that will be deducted from your account balance, converted to the
         currency your account is settled in. It follows the same syntax as the ``amount`` property.

         Note that for refunds, the ``value`` key of ``settlementAmount`` will be negative.

         Any amounts not settled by Mollie will not be reflected in this amount, e.g. PayPal refunds.

         .. list-table::
            :widths: auto

            * - ``currency``

                .. type:: string

            * - ``value``

                .. type:: string

              - A string containing the exact amount that was deducted for the refund from your account balance in the
                settlement currency. Note that this will be negative.

                If the refund is queued and in a different currency than the settlement currency, the settlement amount
                will be ``null`` as the exchange rates may change until the refund is finally executed.

   * - ``description``

       .. type:: string

     - The description of the refund that may be shown to your customer, depending on the payment method used.

   * - ``status``

     - Since refunds may be delayed for certain payment methods, the refund carries a status field.

       Possible values:

       * ``queued`` The refund will be processed once you have enough balance. You can still cancel this refund.
       * ``pending`` The refund will be processed soon (usually the next business day). You can still cancel this
