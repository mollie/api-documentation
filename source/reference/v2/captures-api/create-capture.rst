Create capture
=====================
.. api-name:: Captures API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments/*id*/captures

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: true

Capture an 'authorized' payment.

Some payment methods allow you to first collect a consumer's authorization, and capture the amount at a later point.

By default, Mollie captures payments automatically. If however you configured your payment with captureMode: ``manual``,
you can capture the payment using this endpoint after having collected the consumer's authorization.

For more details about capturing payments, see the guide on
:doc:`Placing a hold for a payment </payments/place-a-hold-for-a-payment>`.

Parameters
----------
Replace ``id`` in the endpoint URL by the payment's ID, for example ``v2/payments/tr_7UhSN1zuXS/captures``.

.. parameter:: amount
   :type: amount object
   :condition: required

   .. parameter:: currency
      :type: string
      :condition: required

      corresponding payment.

   .. parameter:: value
      :type: string
      :condition: required

      A string containing the exact amount you want to capture in the given currency. Make sure to send the right amount
      of decimals. Non-string values are not accepted.

.. parameter:: description

   Set this to ``true`` to capture a test mode payment.
