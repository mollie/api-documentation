Create payment
==============
.. api-name:: Payments API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: true

Payment creation is elemental to the Mollie API: this is where most payment implementations start off.

Once you have created a payment, you should redirect your customer to the URL in the ``_links.checkout`` property from
the response.

To wrap your head around the payment process, an explanation and flow charts can be found in the
:doc:`Accepting payments guide </payments/accepting-payments>`.

.. note::
   :ref:`Optional parameters<payment-method-specific-parameters>` are accepted for certain payment methods.

Parameters
----------
.. parameter:: amount
   :type: amount object
   :condition: required

   The amount that you want to charge, e.g. ``{"currency":"EUR", "value":"1000.00"}`` if you would want to charge
   €1000.00.

   You can find the `minimum and maximum amounts <https://help.mollie.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000667365>`_ per payment
   method in our help center. Additionally, they can be retrieved using :doc:`/reference/v2/methods-api/get-method`.

   .. parameter:: currency
      :type: string
      :condition: required

      An `ISO 4217 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`_ currency code. The
      :doc:`currencies supported </payments/multicurrency>` depend on the payment methods that are enabled on your
      account.

   .. parameter:: value
      :type: string
      :condition: required

      A string containing the exact amount you want to charge in the given currency. Make sure to send the right amount
      of decimals and omit the thousands separator. Non-string values are not accepted.

.. parameter:: description
   :type: string
   :condition: required
   :collapse-children: true

   The description of the payment you are creating. This will be shown to your customer on their card or bank statement
   when possible. We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment method. The
   description is also visible in any exports you generate.

   We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back office.
   This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

   The maximum length of the description field differs per payment method, with the absolute maximum being 255 characters.
   The API will not reject strings longer than the maximum length but it will truncate them to fit.

.. parameter:: redirectUrl
   :type: string
   :condition: required

   The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

   It could make sense for the ``redirectUrl`` to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the
   right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

   The parameter can be omitted for recurring payments (``sequenceType: recurring``) and for Apple Pay payments with an
   ``applePayPaymentToken``.

.. parameter:: cancelUrl
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   The URL your consumer will be redirected to when the consumer explicitly cancels the payment. If this URL is not
   provided, the consumer will be redirected to the ``redirectUrl`` instead — see above.

   Mollie will always give you status updates via :doc:`webhooks </overview/webhooks>`, including for the ``canceled``
   status. This parameter is therefore entirely optional, but can be useful when implementing a dedicated
   consumer-facing flow to handle payment cancellations.

   The parameter can be omitted for recurring payments (``sequenceType: recurring``) and for Apple Pay payments with an
   ``applePayPaymentToken``.

.. parameter:: webhookUrl
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   Set the webhook URL, where we will send payment status updates to.

   The ``webhookUrl`` is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important
   :doc:`status changes </overview/webhooks>` to your payment.

   The ``webhookUrl`` must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use ``localhost``. If you want to use
   webhook during development on ``localhost``, you must use a tool like
   `ngrok <https://lornajane.net/posts/2015/test-incoming-webhooks-locally-with-ngrok>`_ to have the webhooks delivered
   to your local machine.

.. parameter:: locale
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   .. _parameters_locale:

   Allows you to preset the language to be used in the hosted payment pages shown to the consumer. Setting a locale is
   highly recommended and will greatly improve your conversion rate. When this parameter is omitted, the browser
   language will be used instead if supported by the payment method. You can provide any ``xx_XX`` format ISO 15897
   locale, but our hosted payment pages currently only support the following languages:

   Possible values: ``en_US`` ``en_GB`` ``nl_NL`` ``nl_BE`` ``fr_FR`` ``fr_BE`` ``de_DE`` ``de_AT`` ``de_CH`` ``es_ES``
   ``ca_ES`` ``pt_PT`` ``it_IT`` ``nb_NO`` ``sv_SE`` ``fi_FI`` ``da_DK`` ``is_IS`` ``hu_HU`` ``pl_PL`` ``lv_LV`` ``lt_LT``

.. parameter:: method
   :type: string|array
   :condition: optional

   Normally, a payment method screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, you can choose a specific payment
   method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the chosen payment method. The
   parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.

   You can also specify the methods in an array. By doing so we will still show the payment method selection screen but
   will only show the methods specified in the array. For example, you can use this functionality to only show payment
   methods from a specific country to your customer ``['bancontact', 'belfius']``.

   Possible values: ``applepay`` ``bancontact`` ``banktransfer`` ``belfius`` ``creditcard`` ``directdebit`` ``eps``
   ``giftcard`` ``giropay`` ``ideal`` ``kbc`` ``mybank``  ``paypal`` ``paysafecard`` ``przelewy24`` ``sofort``

   .. note:: If you are looking to create payments with the Klarna Pay now, Klarna Pay later, Klarna Slice it, in3 or
      voucher payment methods, use :doc:`/reference/v2/orders-api/create-order` instead.

.. parameter:: restrictPaymentMethodsToCountry
   :type: string
   :condition: optional
   :collapse: true

   For digital goods in most jurisdictions, you must apply the VAT rate from your customer's country. Choose the VAT
   rates you have used for the order to ensure your customer's country matches the VAT country.

   Use this parameter to restrict the payment methods available to your customer to those from a single country.

   If available, the credit card method will still be offered, but only cards from the allowed country are accepted.

   The field expects a country code in `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>`_ format,
   for example `NL`.

.. parameter:: metadata
   :type: mixed
   :condition: optional
   :collapse: true

   Provide any data you like, for example a string or a JSON object. We will save the data alongside the payment.
   Whenever you fetch the payment with our API, we will also include the metadata. You can use up to approximately 1kB.

Parameters for recurring payments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Recurring payments are created through the Payments API by providing a ``sequenceType``. For the ``recurring`` sequence
type, you have to provide a ``customerId`` to indicate which account you want to charge. You can charge a card by
providing a ``mandateId``. See our guide on :doc:`Recurring </payments/recurring>` for more information.

.. parameter:: sequenceType
   :type: string
   :condition: required for recurring
   :collapse: true

   Indicate which type of payment this is in a recurring sequence. If set to ``first``, a
   :ref:`first payment <payments/recurring/first-payment>` is created for the customer, allowing the customer to agree
   to automatic recurring charges taking place on their account in the future. If set to ``recurring``, the customer's
   card is charged automatically.

   Defaults to ``oneoff``, which is a regular non-recurring payment.

   Possible values: ``oneoff`` ``first`` ``recurring``

   For PayPal payments, recurring is only possible if PayPal has activated Reference Transactions on your merchant
   account. Check if you account is eligible via our :doc:`Methods API </reference/v2/methods-api/list-methods>` with
   parameter ``sequenceType`` set to ``first``. Your account is eligible if PayPal is returned in the method list.

.. parameter:: customerId
   :type: string
   :condition: required
   :collapse: true

   The ID of the :doc:`customer </reference/v2/customers-api/get-customer>` for whom the payment is being created. This
   is used primarily for :doc:`recurring payments </payments/recurring>`, but can also be used on regular payments to
   enable :doc:`single-click payments </payments/hosted-checkout>`.

   Tthis field needs to be provided for payments with the ``recurring`` sequence type.

.. parameter:: mandateId
   :type: string
   :condition: optional
   :collapse: true

   When creating recurring payments, the ID of a specific :doc:`mandate </reference/v2/mandates-api/get-mandate>` can be
   supplied to indicate which of the consumer's accounts should be credited.

.. _payment-method-specific-parameters:

Payment method-specific parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you specify the ``method`` parameter, optional parameters may be available for the payment method. If no method is
specified, you can still send the optional parameters and we will apply them when the consumer selects the relevant
payment method.

Apple Pay
"""""""""
.. parameter:: applePayPaymentToken
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   The `Apple Pay Payment Token
   <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/applepaypayment/1916095-token>`_  object (encoded as
   JSON) that is part of the result of authorizing a payment request. The token contains the payment information needed
   to authorize the payment.

   The object should be passed encoded in a JSON string. Example:

   ``{"paymentData": {"version": "EC_v1", "data": "vK3BbrCbI/...."}}``

Bank transfer
"""""""""""""
.. parameter:: billingEmail
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   Consumer's email address, to automatically send the bank transfer details to. **Note:** the payment instructions will
   will be sent immediately when creating the payment. If you do not specify the ``locale`` parameter, the email will be
   sent in English, as we haven't yet been able to detect the consumer's browser language.

.. parameter:: dueDate
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   The date the payment should :doc:`expire </payments/status-changes>`, in ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. **Note:** the minimum
   date is tomorrow and the maximum date is 100 days after tomorrow.

   After you created the payment, you can still update the ``dueDate`` via
   :doc:`/reference/v2/payments-api/update-payment`.

.. parameter:: locale
   :type: string
   :condition: optional

   For bank transfer payments specifically, the locale will determine the target bank account the customer has to
   transfer the money to. We have dedicated bank accounts for Belgium, Germany, and The Netherlands. Having the customer
   use a local bank account greatly increases the conversion and speed of payment.

   Possible values: ``en_US`` ``en_GB`` ``nl_NL`` ``nl_BE`` ``fr_FR`` ``fr_BE`` ``de_DE`` ``de_AT`` ``de_CH`` ``es_ES``

Mollie Connect parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payments that are processed through your app, either by defining an
*application fee* or by *splitting the payment*. To learn more about the difference, refer to the
:doc:`Mollie Connect overview </connect/overview>`.

.. parameter:: applicationFee
   :type: object
   :condition: optional
   :collapse: true

   Adding an :doc:`application fee </connect/application-fees>` allows you to charge the merchant a small sum for the
   payment and transfer this to your own account.

   .. parameter:: amount
      :type: amount object
      :condition: required

      The fee that the app wants to charge, e.g. ``{"currency":"EUR", "value":"10.00"}`` if the app would want to charge
      €10.00.

      There need to be enough funds left from the payment to deduct the Mollie payment fees as well. For example, you
      cannot charge a €0.99 fee on a €1.00 payment. The API will return an error if the requested application fee is too
      high for the specific payment amount and method.

      .. parameter:: currency
         :type: string
         :condition: required

         the right amount of decimals. Non-string values are not accepted.

   .. parameter:: destination
      :type: object
      :condition: required

      The destination of this portion of the payment.

      .. parameter:: type
         :type: string
         :condition: required

         The type of destination. Currently only the destination type ``organization`` is supported.

         Possible values: ``organization``

      .. parameter:: organizationId
         :type: string
         :condition: conditional

         Required for destination type ``organization``. The ID of the connected organization the funds should be routed
         to, for example ``org_12345``.

         **Note:** ``me`` or the ID of the current organization are not accepted as an ``organizationId``. After all
         portions of the total payment amount have been routed, the amount left will be routed to the current
         organization automatically.

   .. parameter:: releaseDate
      :type: date
      :condition: optional

      Optionally, schedule this portion of the payment to be transferred to its destination on a later date. The date
      must be given in ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format.

      If no date is given, the funds become available to the balance as soon as the payment succeeds.

QR codes
^^^^^^^^
To create a payment with a QR code embedded in the API response, explicitly set the payment method and call the API
endpoint with an include request for ``details.qrCode`` in the query string:

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments?include=details.qrCode

QR codes can be generated for iDEAL, Bancontact and bank transfer payments.

Refer to the :doc:`Get payment </reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment>` reference to see what the API response looks
like when the QR code is included.

Response
--------
``201`` ``application/hal+json``

A payment object is returned, as described in :doc:`/reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment`.
