Create payment
==============
.. api-name:: Payments API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :oauth: true

Payment creation is elemental to the Mollie API: this is where most payment implementations start off. Note optional
parameters are accepted for certain payment methods.

To wrap your head around the payment process, an explanation and flow charts can be found in the
:doc:`Overview </index>`.

Parameters
----------
.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``amount``

       .. type:: object
          :required: true

     - The amount that you want to charge, e.g. ``{"currency":"EUR", "value":"100.00"}`` if you would want to charge
       €100.00.

       .. list-table::
          :widths: auto

          * - ``currency``

              .. type:: string
                 :required: true

            - An `ISO 4217 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`_ currency code. The currencies supported depend on
              the payment methods that are enabled on your account.

          * - ``value``

              .. type:: string
                 :required: true

            - A string containing the exact amount you want to charge in the given currency. Make sure to send the right
              amount of decimals. Non-string values are not accepted.

   * - ``description``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - The description of the payment you're creating. This will be shown to the consumer on their card or bank
       statement when possible. We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment
       method. The description is also visible in any exports you generate.

       We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order. This is
       particularly useful for bookkeeping.

   * - | ``redirectUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - The URL the customer will be redirected to after the payment process. It could make sense for the
       ``redirectUrl`` to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the right page referencing
       the order when your customer returns.

       .. note::
          For payments with ``sequenceType`` ``recurring``, you can skip this parameter. For all other payments, this
          parameter is required.

   * - | ``webhookUrl``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

     - Set the webhook URL, where we will send payment status updates to.

       .. note:: The ``webhookUrl`` must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use ``localhost``. If
          you want to use webhook during development on ``localhost``, you must use a tool like
          `ngrok <https://lornajane.net/posts/2015/test-incoming-webhooks-locally-with-ngrok>`_ to have the webhooks
          delivered to your local machine.

   * - | ``locale``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Allows you to preset the language to be used in the payment screens shown to the consumer. Setting a
       locale is highly recommended and will greatly improve your conversion rate. When this parameter is omitted, the
       browser language will be used instead if supported by the payment method. You can provide any ISO 15897 locale,
       but our payment screen currently only supports the following languages:

       Possible values: ``en_US`` ``nl_NL`` ``nl_BE`` ``fr_FR`` ``fr_BE`` ``de_DE`` ``de_AT`` ``de_CH`` ``es_ES`` ``ca_ES`` ``pt_PT`` ``it_IT`` ``nb_NO`` ``sv_SE`` ``fi_FI`` ``da_DK`` ``is_IS`` ``hu_HU`` ``pl_PL`` ``lv_LV`` ``lt_LT``

   * - | ``method``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Normally, a payment method selection screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, your
       customer will skip the selection screen and will be sent directly to the chosen payment method. The parameter
       enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website, however note Mollie's country
       based conversion optimization is lost.

       Possible values: ``bancontact`` ``banktransfer`` ``belfius`` ``bitcoin`` ``creditcard`` ``directdebit``
       ``giftcard`` ``ideal`` ``inghomepay`` ``kbc``  ``paypal`` ``paysafecard`` ``sofort``

   * - | ``metadata``

       .. type:: mixed
          :required: false

     - Provide any data you like, for example a string or a JSON object. We will save the data alongside the
       payment. Whenever you fetch the payment with our API, we'll also include the metadata. You can use up to
       approximately 1kB.

   * - | ``sequenceType``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Indicate which type of payment this is in a recurring sequence. If set to ``first``, a
       :ref:`first payment <guides/recurring/first-payment>` is created for the customer, allowing the customer to agree
       to automatic recurring charges taking place on their account in the future. If set to ``recurring``, the
       customer's card is charged automatically.

       Defaults to ``oneoff``, which is a regular non-recurring payment (see also:
       :doc:`Recurring </guides/recurring>`).

       Possible values: ``oneoff`` ``first`` ``recurring``

   * - | ``customerId``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - The ID of the :doc:`Customer </reference/v2/customers-api/get-customer>` for whom the payment is being created.
       This is used for :doc:`recurring payments </guides/recurring>` and
       :doc:`single click payments </guides/checkout>`.

   * - | ``mandateId``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - When creating recurring payments, the ID of a specific :doc:`Mandate </reference/v2/mandates-api/get-mandate>`
       may be supplied to indicate which of the consumer's accounts should be credited.

Payment method specific parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you specify the ``method`` parameter, optional parameters may be available for the payment method. If no method is
specified, you can still send the optional parameters and we will apply them when the consumer selects the relevant
payment method.

Bank transfer
"""""""""""""
.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - | ``billingEmail``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - Consumer's email address, to automatically send the bank transfer details to. **Please note:** the
       payment instructions will be sent immediately when creating the payment. If you don't specify the ``locale``
       parameter, the email will be sent in English, as we haven't yet been able to detect the consumer's browser
       language.

   * - | ``dueDate``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - The date the payment should :doc:`expire </guides/payment-status-changes>`, in ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format.
       **Please note:** the minimum date is tomorrow and the maximum date is 100 days after tomorrow.

   * - | ``locale``

       .. type:: string
          :required: false

     - The locale will determine the target bank account the customer has to transfer the money to. We have
       dedicated bank accounts for Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands. Having the customer use a local bank
       account greatly increases the conversion and speed of payment.

       Possible values: ``en_US`` ``de_AT`` ``de_CH`` ``de_DE`` ``es_ES`` ``fr_BE`` ``fr_FR`` ``nl_BE`` ``nl_NL``

include request for ``details.qrCode`` in the query string:

QR codes can be generated for iDEAL, Bitcoin, Bancontact and bank transfer payments.

Refer to the :doc:`Get payment </reference/v2/payments-api/get-payment>` reference to see what the API response looks
like when the QR code is included.

Response
