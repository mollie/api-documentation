Get payment
===========
.. api-name:: Payments API
   :version: 2

.. endpoint::
   :method: GET
   :url: https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments/*id*

.. authentication::
   :api_keys: true
   :organization_access_tokens: true
   :oauth: true

Retrieve a single payment object by its payment token.

.. note:: We call your webhook when the :doc:`payment status changes </payments/status-changes>`, so there's no
          need to poll this endpoint for status changes.

Parameters
----------
Replace ``id`` in the endpoint URL by the payment's ID, for example ``tr_7UhSN1zuXS``.

Access token parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using :doc:`organization access tokens </overview/authentication>` or are creating an
:doc:`OAuth app </connect/overview>`, you can enable test mode through the ``testmode`` query string parameter.

.. parameter:: testmode
   :type: boolean
   :condition: optional
   :collapse: true

   Set this to ``true`` to get a payment made in test mode. If you omit this parameter, you can only retrieve live mode
   payments.

Includes
^^^^^^^^
This endpoint allows you to include additional information by appending the following values via the ``include``
querystring parameter.

* ``details.qrCode`` Include a :doc:`QR code </payments/qr-codes>` object. Only available for iDEAL, Bancontact
  and bank transfer payments.
* ``details.remainderDetails`` Include the `Payment method-specific response parameters`_ of the 'remainder payment' as
  well. This applies to gift card and voucher payments where only part of the payment was completed with gift cards or
  vouchers, and the remainder was completed with a regular payment method.

Embedding of related resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This endpoint also allows for embedding additional information by appending the following values via the ``embed``
query string parameter.

* ``refunds`` Include all :doc:`refunds </reference/v2/refunds-api/get-payment-refund>` created for the payment.
