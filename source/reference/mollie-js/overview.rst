Mollie.js
=========
Mollie's browser-side JavaScript library is called **Mollie.js**. You can use it to offer a more deeply embedded
checkout experience. See the guides on :doc:`Mollie Components </components/overview>` and on
:doc:`building your own checkout </payments/build-your-own-checkout>` for more information.

The ``Mollie`` object is used to initialize Mollie Components. ``Component`` objects each reference an embeddable
checkout component, such as a credit card number field or a credit card expiry date field.

For a step-by-step tutorial on integrating Mollie Components, please refer to the
:doc:`Mollie Components guide </components/overview>`.
