Claim account
==============

.. api-name:: Reseller API
   :version: 1

.. note::
    On the 6th of February 2019, we disabled this endpoint and therefore it is no longer possible to claim existing
    accounts. As an alternative, you can make use of our :doc:`OAuth flow </oauth/onboarding>` that automatically
    claims an account after the merchant signed up as a new Mollie customer.
