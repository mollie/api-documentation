Managing your customers
================================

Mollie Connect assists you in monitoring and managing your customer's onboarding process through a set of dashboards, providing 
both an overview of all your customers, as well as a detailed per-client view.

.. note:: Your app needs to request 'organizations.read' and 'onboarding.read' permissions to access data of your customers in 
    the dashboards.

Partner or marketplace clients page  
-----------------------------------

This page offers an overview of all connected and onboarding merchants, searchable by organization name and ID. Check onboarding status 
(``needs-data``, ``in-review``, ``completed``) and the blocked payments indicator (available, pending, blocked) to identify accounts needing assistance.

Detailed clients page  
---------------------

Each connected client has a Client detail page where you can check organization details, a list of payment profiles (including statuses and enabled 
payment methods), and an overview of the merchant's onboarding steps. This provides full visibility for guiding your clients effectively.
