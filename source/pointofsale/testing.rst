Test your Point of Sale integration
===================================
.. note:: Point of Sale is currently in beta. If you are interested in offering Point of Sale payments, please see
   `this page <https://www.mollie.com/products/payments-terminal>`_ for more information on our product offering. Once
   there, you can register your interest to be kept up-to-date.

As explained in our guide on :doc:`Testing the Mollie API </overview/testing>`, you can use test mode to ensure your
integration works as expected, before rolling it out to your customers.

We offer the same functionality for our Point of Sale offering, by supporting `test mode` for the
:doc:`Terminals API </reference/v2/terminals-api/overview>` as well. You can use a `test mode` terminal in combination
with a `test mode` payment to walk through the payment process. Therefore, it is not required to purchase a terminal in
order to integrate our Point of Sale solution.

Setting up a test mode terminal
-------------------------------
In order to set up a test mode terminal, you will only have to enable the Point of Sale payment method. A test mode
terminal will then be created for you automatically.

As described in the :doc:`Point of Sale payments guide </pointofsale/point-of-sale>`, you will need to provide the
terminal ID of a terminal in order to create a Point of Sale payment. You can retrieve the terminal ID of the test mode
terminal by calling the :doc:`List Terminals endpoint </reference/v2/terminals-api/list-terminals>` with your test mode
credentials. This would either be your test API key or an organization or app access token while passing the
``testmode`` parameter with value ``true``.

Creating a test mode payment
----------------------------
Now that you have the terminal ID of the test mode terminal, you can create a test mode Point of Sale payment by
calling the :doc:`Create Payment endpoint </reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment>` with your test credentials and
by passing ``pointofsale`` as the payment method and the terminal ID as the ``terminalId`` parameter. For example:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   curl -X POST https://api.mollie.com/v2/payments \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM" \
       -d "amount[currency]=EUR" \
       -d "amount[value]=10.00" \
       -d "description=My first in-person payment" \
       -d "redirectUrl=https://cash-register.example.org/order/12345/" \
       -d "webhookUrl=https://cash-register.example.org/payments/webhook/" \
       -d "method=pointofsale" \
       -d "terminalId=term_7MgL4wea46qkRcoTZjWEH"

Since the payment will not actually be shown on a terminal device, the response contains a ``changePaymentState`` URL,
which allows you to set the final payment state. You can try out different payment statuses and see whether your
integration handles it correctly.
